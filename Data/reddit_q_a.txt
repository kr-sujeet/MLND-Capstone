t1_cqug9pw||People can talk all the shit they want about Giannis, but at least he plays his damn heart out. That's pretty cool||t1_cqugavt||t1_cqug9pw||He does. And I hate him for his long ass arms
t1_cqugb4i||Doing quite well myself. I have a friend of mine over talking about making a new comic series (that's not TPP related). Other then that, job searching, walking around and enjoying the day.||t1_cqugbud||t1_cqugb4i||Cool. Hope that job search goes well senpai. :)(Pioxys x Starmie OTP)

t1_cqugch1||I was there when a huge crowd was waiting for a mish to get off of the plane. He was the last one off. Some dude walks off of the plane and asks the mish's girlfriend if she is waiting on a missionary from the orient. She smiles big and says yes. He tells her that he is in the back of the plane making out with a stewardess. I burst out laughing when the girl started crying.||t1_cqugh6v||t1_cqugch1||That was a dick move on his Part.

t1_cqugc77||So this week was p good.  The annual PT eval I had Tuesday went well, and yesterday we were allowed to wear jeans to show support for Sexual Assault Awareness month, and then today is Earth Day.  Tomorrow I'll hopefully go see the new Avengers movie with my friends, and then hopefully the internet is fixed for this weekend unlike last weekend to relax with some video games.  So how were all of your weeks, and do you have any plans for this weekend (like seeing the new avengers movie)? [:D](http://imgur.com/0CRFw14)||t1_cqugimm||t1_cqugc77||I live in Baltimore and we had riots and protests this week which was pretty exciting.  Other than that my week was pretty chill.  I just finished the last class of my undergrad years and have a bit of a break before all my final papers and stuff are due. 
t1_cqugc6p||Its just a super efficent ion drive and untill an ion drive becomes usable for mars transit it doesn't matter until he gets cheap access to orbit mastered. At which point if this is better then the more proven ion engines for interplanetary travel then they can use them. The plasma engine may get off the drawing board for the MCT by that time as well. Ether that or Musk just thinks EmDrive means Elon Musk drive which is a drive that propels itself by accelerating charged "elon musks" in the opposite direction. And he doesn't want to be used as fuel.||t1_cqugin6||t1_cqugc6p||Ion engines carry mass with them to throw out the back.  The EmDrive does not.

t1_cqughah||Yeah, you're right that they can affect the health of their children. Most fat people probably got their bad habits from somewhere. However I'm not so sure that making someone feel like a shitty human being will really help. Most fat people are probably well aware that they being fat is not a good thing (I guess it would be okay to speak up against those who deny that fact, that's just stupid and a outright dangerous opinion).However, since fatness correlate with a lack of education and low-income (in many ways fatness is a matter of class) I think that maybe there are better ways to be attacking this health problem. ||t1_cqugnkj||t1_cqughah||Yeah education definitely needs to be improved, there's a lot of myths with nutrition

t1_cqugm0z||Sometimes when on a nature hike, I get tired of carrying my penis around so I leave it on the trail and pick it up on my way back. One time an animal or person stole it so I attached a squirrel tail to my groin.

t1_cqugo0c||&gt;Big Bang hasn't released anything new in 3 years. That's 1/3 of their existence. Most groups release new material at least once a year. Groups have debuted and disbanded in the time Big Bang has been away. BTS released their last song like 5 months ago and I saw the same responses in that thread.||t1_cqugrbv||t1_cqugo0c||That was a long break for BTS and ARMYS are basically nugu EXO-L so it's to be expected. There's spazzing in every thread. Just trying to justify Big Bang.

t1_cqugsws||Hey now, the Bucks were counted out of the season in preseason, week 1, all star week, and even the start of the playoffs. This whole season was nothing but a success. ||t1_cqugvda||t1_cqugsws||I completely agree. It's a big year for a team that was expected to win 20 games.

t1_cqugg1e||When it gets to that point, why not use a console cheat to restore health? You're basically botting at that point anyway, except it takes way longer.

t1_cqugvix||I've been following hockey for the majority of my life and can't recall this level of hype surrounding a coach potentially leaving to sign with another team. I've heard everything from Edmonton/St. Louis, to the University of Michigan, to staying where he's at. Had Babcock said or done anything to indicate a desire to leave? Or is it just speculation||t1_cqugzx5||t1_cqugvix||Firstly, no way he's going to the University of Michigan. They can't offer him the money or the clout. Well, he certainly hasn't committed to coming back to Detroit yet which is where most of the speculation comes from.Bob McKenzie/Pierre LeBrun has said that Babcock wants to set the market standard for coaches. If Babcock can get a much higher salary, every other coach's salary goes up as well. Also, cause he might want to set a different legacy by winning cups elsewhere too.

t1_cqugl8j||I don't think c and 0.999 999 999 999 999 999 999 9951c are the same... c seems extra special. I don't think it's even possible a particle like a proton *to* move at c. Wouldn't it be at rest in its own reference frame? Also, do photons (traveling at c, of course) even *have* reference frames?||t1_cquh3fk||t1_cqugl8j||The speed of light is c in all reference frames, so there is no rest frame for a photon (the speed of light would be zero in that frame).The oh my god particle would be at rest in its "own reference frame". We call this frame its rest frame. Every massive particle has a rest frame.

The right response was: "must is nonsense, the military is not going to duo that."Or maybe you think the military might be planning this.||t1_cquh4i8||t1_cqugdan||&gt;Because clearly it it's a reasonable possibility that the military would take over Texas.Where does Paul say that? Nowhere in the interview is the military operation even described like that. Paul is asked if he's heard about some military operation, he says no -- he'll look into it. That's it, end of story.The irony here is that *you're* the one actually demanding this absurd theory be given more attention than it's worth. And you're saying the onus is on Paul to somehow know about any given conspiracy at any given moment so that he can adequately dismiss it to your judgement. There's partisan hackery and then below that there's /u/matts2.

Sure, there's some good ones, but the majority of the posts I saw seem to be implying that Tampa's fan base is a bunch of idiots.The posts he linked to were pretty bad, but he's not *trying* to make Detroit look bad, you guys made those posts yourself. I'm sorry if you don't agree with it but that's just the way it is. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of finger pointing like OP is doing, but it's a free forum for expressing ideas and opinions and I'm not going to sensor him, even if it does make us look like sore winners.||t1_cquh614||t1_cqugofg||I've seen terrible posts here too. People get upset when their favorite team loses, and they lash out. It happens. You guys won, we lost. Let's all move on.

The film industry changes with society and society may change because of the media we see. If male-centric films were a problem then the market will force films to change - and the bechdel test remains pointless. That leaves it's only function as some sort of shaming weapon, since it's pointless for anything else.||t1_cquh6ma||t1_cqugp5x||&gt; If it's not used to evaluate the worth of a film, and only to show films are male-centric, then we're still left with the question of "so what?".To borrow your own question, so what? The Bechdel test doesn't purport to do more than illustrate a rough measure of male-centricty, and so I'm not sure what you're criticizing in pointing out that the test doesn't do more than what it purports to do.&gt;If male-centric films were a problem then the market will force films to changeWhy should we expect the market to correct any problems (or this specific problem) in film?

t1_cquh443||Well people voted for Dela over Joslyn last season. And LOLOLOLOL it's not going to be Fame.||t1_cquh7pa||t1_cquh443||They did, which is a shame as imo Joslyn deserved it. That was more a knee jerk reaction from the viewers regarding Dela's loss and people wanting her to have a consolation prize of sorts.
t1_cquh55s||Excellent! Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota are off the clock.  Now let's draft less popular people, but super talented guys, fly under the radar, and come out next season and whoop everybody's ass||t1_cquh7pb||t1_cquh55s||&gt; super talented guysThis right here is an A+ strategy for drafting players, can you GM for us?!
